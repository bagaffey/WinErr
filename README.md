# WinErr
#### A windows batch file that displays windows error messages with a flashing screen and annoying sounds.

This is windows only. Ha ha ha ha.

It's a batch file that cycles through windows error messages. It also changes the colors of the screen and beeps.

It doesn't actually cause the error messages that are displayed. It reads them off through NET HELPMSG.
