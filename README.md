# WinErr
####A windows batch file that displays windows error messages with a flashing screen and sounds.

This is windows only.

It's a batch file that will cycle through windows error messages. It also change the colors of the screen and sound off the
system beep.

It doesn't actually cause the error messages that are displayed. It reads them off through NET HELPMSG.
